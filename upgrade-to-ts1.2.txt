NB
For security reasons, you should change the owner of the /etc/init.d/riak file to the root user after installation has completed. See our product advisory for more information and further instruction.

Did not work.  Uninstalled Riak package to try again. Restarted machine.  Completely removed Riak with apt and some deletions.  Restarted machine again.
